            <p>Hunger and poor-quality education are no doubt interlinked, and continue to plague children across the globe. 
               That’s why at Rise Against Hunger, we actively seek to nurture and nourish the generation of tomorrow by changing their world today. 
               We do this the best way we know how – providing substantial meals.</p>

            <p>  Most children from low-income families go to school hungry, which in turn, hurts their performance in school. 
                 Going hungry does not always means the same thing to everyone. 
                 For some, there may be no food in the house and no money to buy any. Maybe there is food in the house, but not enough to feed all members of the family. </p>
        
            <p>Whatever the situation, more often than not, kids who don’t have continuous access to three healthy meals a day are much more likely to face unhealthy, unsuccessful and uncertain futures.

                Rise Against Hunger meals are provided in schools to encourage increased enrollment and attendance. Our uniquely designed meals provide a comprehensive array of micronutrients, including enriched rice, soy protein, dried vegetables and 23 essential vitamins and nutrients. Supplying students with these regular meals means that they are provided with the necessary energy to perform. When students are no longer hungry, they are able to concentrate and succeed academically, opening doors for future opportunities.

                Our meals are so much more than just meals, they give children peace of mind. With access to food every day, children become less concerned about where their next meal is coming from, and instead, focus on their education and bettering their futures.</p>

            <p>TOGETHER WE CAN END HUNGER.</p>
